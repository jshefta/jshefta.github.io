        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Jessmail and its subsidiaries and affiliates (“Jemi Digital”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). This Privacy Policy describes how we handle personal data we collect online (e.g., through our websites and mobile apps), and offline (e.g., through customer support hotlines and in-person promotional activities) (collectively, the “Services”). This Privacy Policy explains the types of personal data we collect and process, how we may use and share the data, and the choices that are available to you with respect to our handling of your data.</p>

<h2>How We Collect Information</h2>

<p>We may collect personal data from various sources, including:<h3>

<ul>
<li>Directly from you;</li>
<li>Through our websites and mobile apps;</li>
<li>From social media or other public forums; and</li>
<li>From third party vendors or business partners.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Types Of Information We Collect</h2>

<p>The types of personal data we may collect include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Contact information, such as your name, email address, mailing address, and phone number;</li>
<li>Demographic information, such as your date of birth, gender, and zip code;</li>
<li>Account information, such as your username and password;</li>
<li>Billing information, such as credit card details, billing address, and proof of identification; and</li>
<li>When you access the Services through Facebook credentials, the information Facebook makes available to us based on your Facebook privacy settings, such as your name, picture, and email address.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cookies and other information collected by automated means</h2>

<p>We, our service providers, and our business partners, may also collect certain information about the use of our websites and mobile apps by automated means, such as cookies, web beacons and other technologies. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor‘s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, is used to transmit information back to a web server. We and our service providers and business partners may collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites.</p>

<p>The information that may be collected by automated means includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>URLs that refer visitors to our websites;</li>
<li>Search terms used to reach our websites or locate our mobile apps;</li>
<li>Details about the devices that are used to access our websites or mobile apps (such as IP address, browser information, device information, and operating system information);</li>
<li>Details about your interaction with our websites and mobile apps (such as the date, time, length of stay, and specific pages accessed during your visits to our websites and mobile apps, and which emails you may have opened);</li>
<li>Usage information (such as the number and frequency of visitors to our websites); and</li>
<li>Geo-location data (which determines your current locations) from some of our Services, such as mobile apps.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may associate the information we collect by automated means with your Jessmail account if you have one, the device you use to connect to the Services, or email or social media accounts that you use to engage with Jessmail or our partners.</p>

<p>Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based do-not-track (“DNT”) mechanisms, we do not respond to web browser-based DNT signals at this time.</p>

<p>Our retention periods for personal data are based on business needs and legal requirements. We retain personal data for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which the data was collected, and any other permissible, related purpose. For example, we may retain certain transaction details and correspondence until the time limit for claims arising from the transaction has expired. When we no longer need the personal information we collect, we either irreversibly anonymize the information (in which case, we may further retain and use the anonymized information) or securely destroy the information.</p>
